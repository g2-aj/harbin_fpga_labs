# OpenCL For Altera FPGA's

  - Documentation of Altera OpenCL(AOCL)
  - Optimization Methods
  - Video Tutorials

To get an idea of OpenCL in General you can refer to the following videos:
  - [OpenCL 1.2: High-Level Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D6yhpiQVVI)
  - [OpenCL GPU Architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yr-E9w4tGI)
  - [OpenCL 1.2: OpenCL C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKyhHonQMbw)
 
You can also:
  - Use the documentation and build your own FPGA designs
  - Tutorial by Altera to use OpenCL in their Cyclone-V SoC can be found in the following links.

  - The AOCL can also be used with Terasic boards with Altera FPGA's but a different BSP is required with linux image.
    - The  AOCL BSP for Terasic [DE0-NANO-SOC](http://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&No=941) and [DE1-SOC](http://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&No=836) can be found [here](http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fmail.terasic.com.tw%2F~david%2Fde0_nano_soc_openCL_bsp.zip&h=VAQHCKgtM).(use instructions in README.txt to install and use works only with SDK v14.0 and SoCEDS v14.0)
